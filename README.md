# bookmarks

Share Firefox bookmarks using XBEL.

Two scripts that can generate XBEL from Firefox bookmarks.
1. Parse the JSON file exported using Firefox
2. Generate XBEL from the Firefox places.sqlite

A nice XSLT is available from here:

It uses some CSS and an image file also availale from the same location.
